// Run Backend:
Can use npm start
but as using nodemon to continuously watch server for changes we use npm run server


// Run Frontend:
Navigate to Client folder and run npm start



// Running Frontend & Backend concurrently
in main folder run npm run dev
needed to remove proxy in server package.json as was causing issues with running react
